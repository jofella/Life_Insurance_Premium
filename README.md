# Reserves Calculation in Life Insurance

This project implements a basic reserve calculation model for life insurance using MATLAB. The reserve is calculated based on actuarial assumptions and mortality data provided in an Excel table.

## Overview

The goal of this script is to compute the present value of future liabilities under a typical life insurance contract using the net premium method. The implementation is intended for academic or illustrative purposes.

## Files

- `reserves_calculation.m`: Core MATLAB script for performing the calculations.
- `Sterbetafel.xlsx`: Mortality table used as input data.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2020b or newer recommended)
- No additional toolboxes required

## Usage

1. Place both files (`reserves_calculation.m` and `Sterbetafel.xlsx`) in the same directory.
2. Open MATLAB and run the script:
   ```matlab
   reserves_calculation
